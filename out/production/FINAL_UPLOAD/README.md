# BSU Visitor Log System: Secure Campus Entry-Exit Management

> **A Final Project for CS 211 (Object-Oriented Programming).**

The **BSU Visitor Log System** is a console-based Java application designed to modernize the security monitoring process at Batangas State University - Lipa Campus. It replaces traditional manual logbooks with a secure digital database, ensuring efficiency, data integrity, and accountability.

This project aligns with **SDG 9** (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by digitizing manual processes, **SDG 12** (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting paperless operations, and **SDG 16** (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) by enhancing security protocols.
